# J2EE:-(Abstraction)



* Hiding the implementation and providing the functionalities to the user with the help of interface is known as **Abstraction.**
* We need to hide the implementation to reduce the complexity.





## **Interface:-**



* Interface is a medium to communicate between user and any device.
* It is a coding contract between service and the consumer.



## Tight Coupling:-



* Change in the implementation which affects the user is known as Tight Coupling.



## Loose Coupling:-



* Change in the implementation which does not affects the user is known as Loose Coupling.



## Port Number:-



* Port number is the one which helps us to get connected to a particular server.

##### &nbsp;



**DATABASE SERVER                   PORT NUMBER**

1. Oracle                          1521
2. MySQL                           3306
3. MS-SQL                          1433
4. Derby                           1527



## API:-(Application Programming interface)

* API stand for Application Programming interface
* API is used for inter-application communication that is one application can communicates with another application with the help of API to achieve loose coupling.
* API's are even in the form of jar file.
* whenever API's are given in the form of jar file then such API's are developed by using java as a programming language.
* eg:- Apach POI, Jaxcel , JDBC API , Servlet API





### Contents of API:-

Totally there are 3 different contents with respect to API:-

1. Interfaces
2. Helper Classes
3. Implementation Classes



### Forms of API:-

There are two different forms of api present:-

1. I form of API
2. II form of API



### 1.I form of API:-

* I form of API contains **Interfaces, Helper classes and Implementation Classes** within **One Single Jar File.**

  **eg: Apache POI**
