//I write this program to check,try and get comfortable with COMMENTS.

/*
🚫 What Not to Do:-
❌ Don't over-comment obvious lines

❌ Don't repeat what the code clearly shows

❌ Don't write outdated comments — keep them updated

❌ Don’t write essays in your code!
*/

class CheckComments
{
	//here we change the order of Main Method,Just to check it's working or not?
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		System.out.println("This program is for \"COMMENTS\" and Check after change the order of \"main method\" it's working or show errors?");
	}
}

/*
✔️Main Method:-
The mentor has said us that these order of main method doesn't effect in any way on our output but here when I try this this shows errors.
but the order of "String[] args" will don't effect in any way and even after change it's order the code works Properly
*/

/*
🪄 Tips to Practice:-

Write comments like you're helping your future self (who forgot the logic).

Read open-source Java projects on GitHub to see real-world comment styles.

After writing code, review it once only for comments.
